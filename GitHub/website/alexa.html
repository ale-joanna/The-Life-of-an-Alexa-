      <h3 id="subtitles"> About Me</h3>
      <p>I was born in Mexico and came to the United States at the age of 7 with no clue as to how my life would form but when I started Elementary school I discovered my love for learning.</p>
      <p> I have two half brothers who live with me  and one half sister who does not, as well as a Shih Tzu named Johnny. I live with my mother, step-father, and two younger brothers. Fast-forward my life and I am currently 17 years old and a rising senior in highschool where I recently discovered my interest in computer science and decided to apply for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.</p>
